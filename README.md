## Using Issues and Discussions

### Confirm the Novelty of Your Issue or Discussion
Before opening a new issue or discussion on an FLCAC repo, please first confirm that your concern hasn't already been raised or addressed. Review the lists of issuesâ€”both open and closed (e.g., [this repo's issues](https://github.com/FLCAC-admin/FLCAC-docs/issues?q=))â€”and [discussions](https://github.com/FLCAC-admin/FLCAC-docs/discussions) across the subset of FLCAC repos relevant to your issue:

 Topic | Repository
 --- | ---
 Federal Elementary Flow List | [fedelemflowlist](https://github.com/USEPA/fedelemflowlist)
 LCIA methods on the FLCAC | [LCIA formatter](https://github.com/USEPA/LCIAformatter)
 USLCI | [USLCI-content](https://github.com/FLCAC-admin/uslci-content)
 US Electricity Baseline | [ElectricityLCI](https://github.com/NETL-RIC/ElectricityLCI)
 Anything else | [FLCAC-docs](https://github.com/FLCAC-admin/FLCAC-docs)


### Issues
Issues are generally intended to report bugs and request enhancements related to the topic of that GitHub repository.
It is helpful if issues have a clear path towards resolution.

- Please [apply labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels#applying-a-label) to issues to help keep them organized. The list of labels available in each repository can be viewed via the Labels button on the Issues tab (e.g., [FLCAC-docs labels](https://github.com/FLCAC-admin/FLCAC-docs/labels)).
- Examples of content ideal for issues:
  - Did you find an incorrect flow mapping or conversion factor in the [All Mappings](https://dmap-data-commons-ord.s3.amazonaws.com/fedelemflowlist/All_Mappings.xlsx) file?
    Post an issue here: [fedelemflowlist](https://github.com/USEPA/fedelemflowlist)
  - Suggest a [targeted enhancement to the FEDEFL](https://github.com/USEPA/fedelemflowlist/issues/137).

### Discussions
For topics with a wider scope or where more discussion may be required to reach a resolution, please post it as a discussion topic.

Please apply labels to help keep the discussion list organized.
Discussions rely on the same set of repository-specific labels used by Issues (e.g., [FLCAC-docs labels](https://github.com/FLCAC-admin/FLCAC-docs/labels)).

# Results

This folder contains programatically generated LCIA results for processes within select repositories.
See the associated `_meta.json` file for metadata on the date and commit status at time of running the results.
These results can be used to assess changes across releases and to help validate process level results in external software tools.

**Important**: Results **do not** reflect complete supply chains, but only connected processess within the given database.
These results **should not** be used as emission factors.

🚧 **This site is under construction. New content will continue to be added** 🚧

Welcome to the Federal LCA Commons documentation site.
Here we provide guidance and resources for accessing data from the Federal LCA Commons (www.lcacommons.gov).

This site is generated with [MyST Markdown](https://mystmd.org/) from content stored on the [FLCAC-docs GitHub repository](https://github.com/FLCAC-admin/FLCAC-docs).

:::{hint}
A table of contents is provided in the left sidebar, or on narrow screens can be accessed with the menu icon (three horizontal bars) at the top-left corner.

# Have Questions?
First, please refer to the documentation on this site:
 - For questions on Data Use, Data Submission, or Repo Management, use the site menu (left side) to navigate.
 - Check out the [Frequently Asked Questions](https://flcac-admin.github.io/FLCAC-docs/faq) page.
 - Have a terminology question? Check out the [Glossary](https://flcac-admin.github.io/FLCAC-docs/glossary).
 - The [Other Resources](https://flcac-admin.github.io/FLCAC-docs/otherresources) page can also help direct you to useful resources.

If the above resources fail to answer your question, consider opening a new issue or contributing to a discussion thread.

## Using Issues and Discussions

### Confirm the Novelty of Your Issue or Discussion
Before opening a new issue or discussion on an FLCAC repo, please first confirm that your concern hasn't already been raised or addressed. Review the lists of issues—both open and closed (e.g., [this repo's issues](https://github.com/FLCAC-admin/FLCAC-docs/issues?q=))—and [discussions](https://github.com/FLCAC-admin/FLCAC-docs/discussions) across the subset of FLCAC repos relevant to your issue:

 Topic | Repository
 --- | ---
 Federal Elementary Flow List | [fedelemflowlist](https://github.com/USEPA/fedelemflowlist)
 LCIA methods on the FLCAC | [LCIA formatter](https://github.com/USEPA/LCIAformatter)
 USLCI | [USLCI-content](https://github.com/FLCAC-admin/uslci-content)
 Anything else | [FLCAC-docs](https://github.com/FLCAC-admin/FLCAC-docs)

### Issues
[**Issues**](https://github.com/FLCAC-admin/FLCAC-docs/issues) are generally intended to report errors and request improvements related to the documentation.
It is helpful if issues have a clear path towards resolution.
Please [apply labels](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels#applying-a-label) to issues to help keep them organized. The list of available labels can be viewed via the Labels button on the Issues tab (e.g., [FLCAC-docs labels](https://github.com/FLCAC-admin/FLCAC-docs/labels)).

### Discussions
For topics with a wider scope or where more discussion may be required to reach a resolution, please post it as a [**Discussion**](https://github.com/FLCAC-admin/FLCAC-docs/discussions).
Please apply labels to help keep the discussion list organized.
Discussions rely on the same set of repository-specific labels used by Issues.

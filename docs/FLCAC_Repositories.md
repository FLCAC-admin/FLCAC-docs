## Repository List

The repositories available on the FLCAC are shown below.
Visit the FLCAC Collaboration Server to [Access these Repositories](https://www.lcacommons.gov/lca-collaboration).
See [Accessing FLCAC Data](Accessing_data.md) for information on how to download and use data.
Repositories are classified as the following types:

- **LCI**: contains Life Cycle Inventory data as {term}`unit processes <unit process>` or {term}`system processes <system process>` or input-output data.
- **LCIA**: Repositories of Life Cycle Inventory Assessment methods
- **Background**: Repositories with background data such as flow lists.
- **Legacy**: Repositories with LCI data not actively maintained.

[^USLCI]: New data is expected to include on-road mobile combustion updates, wastewater treatment processes, stationary combustion updates, and lithium production.

[^Woody]: Integration of USLCI as a library; additional processes for the full forest productâ€™s supply chain from forest management and harvesting to primary forest products like lumber and secondary forest products like wood flooring. Combining the USFS FPL and the CORRIM Forestry and Forest Products repository into one.

[^Asphalt]: Removing the embedded version of USLCI and revised connections to other repositories.

## US Life Cycle Inventory

The NREL U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database (USLCI) is a home for U.S. industry LCI data. The USLCI database provides individual gate-to-gate, cradle-to-gate, and cradle-to-grave accounting of the energy and material flows into and out of the environment that are associated with producing a material, component, or assembly in the U.S.

For more information, please visit the [USLCI Homepage](https://www.nrel.gov/analysis/lci.html) or the [USLCI GitHub Site](https://github.com/FLCAC-admin/uslci-content)

ðŸ“º ðŸ”‰ [Training videos are also provided](video.md) for accessing, using, and submitting data to the USLCI.

## Pavement LCA

### [LCA Pave Tool](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/lcatool/)

> LCA Pave is a MicrosoftÂ® ExcelÂ® based tool developed by FHWA that can be used to assess environmental impacts of pavement material and design decisions. <br> <br>
> The tool is intended to be used as a training and informational product only and for voluntary use by agencies and individuals with an understanding of fundamental LCA principles. Its use is not required by Federal statute or regulation.
>

### [Sustainable Pavement Reference Library](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/sustainability/library/)

This website links to many useful resources regarding pavement LCA, pavement EPDs and sustainable pavement programs.
